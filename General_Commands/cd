Change to another directory

Tips: 

Using the Tab key will help auto-complete the directory you are typing in. For example, when trying to change to the "Documents" directory. Type in cd Doc+Tab and as long as there are no other folders starting with "Doc"; the terminal will auto fill the remainder of the directory's name for you so you can type less.

Try and becareful when naming directories for the most optimal use of the "cd" command. If all of your directories have similar starts to their names (i.e. lessons1, lessons2, lessons3), you won't be able to use the shortcut with Tab. << Oof, learned that the hard way

"cd .." will bring you to the parent folder.

You can chain the above to move back/up multiple parent folders. For example, "cd ../../.."
