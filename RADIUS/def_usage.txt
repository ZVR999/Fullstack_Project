Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service

This service enables remote users to log on to a network through a shared authentication database. 

When attempting to log in, a user's credentials will be sent to a RADIUS client which sends these credentials to a RADIUS server.



Tips: a war dialer program would be a standard and active threat for a company's remote access system to get into their internal network.
